# Tiktok Project
## Project goal:
The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

## Background:
TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic contentâ€“where people can safely discover, create, and connect.
## Tasks: 
In this project, I undertook the following tasks to support TikTok's claim classification data:

**Data Processing:**
* Collected and cleaned data from TikTok videos.
* Handled missing values, outliers, and ensured data consistency.
* Performed feature engineering to create meaningful variables for the model.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
* Conducted comprehensive EDA to understand data distribution and relationships.
* Visualized key patterns.

**Hypothesis Testing:**
* Formulated and tested hypotheses to validate assumptions about the data.
* Used statistical tests to identify significant features for the model.

**Regression Model Development:**
* Built and trained a regression model to classify claims.
* Evaluated model performance
